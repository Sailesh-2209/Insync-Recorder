# Insync Recorder

An android application created as part of my Final Year Project.

## What is it?

It is an application that can record video footage synchronously from two devices
and transfer the file to a host computer.

## How does it work?

Insync Recorder needs to be downloaded on two different android devices and run at
the same time. This android app works along with the java applet which can be found
[here](https://www.github.com/Sailesh-2209/Socket-Server).  
Download this java applet and run it on a computer. This computer and the two recording
devices must be connected to the same WiFi network. The transmission of the 
`START RECORDING` and `STOP RECORDING` signals and the recorded files will happen
wirelessly over WiFi.
